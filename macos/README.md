### macOS Script Instructions (Improved)

1. **Download the File**:  
   Save the `privacy-script.sh` file to your desired folder (e.g., `Downloads`).

2. **Open Terminal**:  
   Launch the Terminal application from your macOS Applications or search for it using Spotlight (`Cmd + Space`, then type "Terminal").

3. **Navigate to the Downloaded File**:  
   Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where the file is located. For example:  
   ```bash
   cd ~/Downloads
   ```

4. **Grant Execute Permissions**:  
   Make the script executable by running the following command:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x privacy-script.sh
   ```

5. **Run the Script**:  
   Execute the script by typing:  
   ```bash
   ./privacy-script.sh
   ```

6. **Provide Administrator Access (if prompted)**:  
   Enter your administrator password when prompted to allow the script to make necessary changes.  

> **Note**: Ensure you trust the source of the script before running it, as it requires elevated permissions.
